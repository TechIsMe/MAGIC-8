## Description

The app is built using HTML, CSS and JS.
The way the magic8-ball is gonna work is, we've got a text field here and we're goona type in the questions and shake it and find out the answers.
If we keep on shaking it it actually generates a whole bunch of different possiblites.

## Tools

HTML, CSS, JS.
